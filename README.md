# Golang application
The application was created to learn the Go programming language. The first stage was to create a simple application. The next stages were to introduce extensions such as:
* [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
* Connection with database (Postgresql).
* Gorilla.
* Layers (like interfaces, implementations).
* Unit tests.
* Independent data sources (db and external api).
* Cache.

# Technical functionality
* CRUD operations.
* Cooperate with [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)(Free fake API for testing and prototyping).
* The data is "stored" in the database and external api. 
* Data is also cached.
